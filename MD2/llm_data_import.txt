Generate the following JSON dataset.

Ensure that the dataset is localised to the Latvia (consider social security number, names, places, etc.)
I want following dataset:

Insurance companies (5 to 10 entries)
Persons (20 entries)
- social_security_number
- full_name
- date_of_birth
- address
- phone_number
- risk_level (0-10 scale)

Policies (10-20 entries)
- policy_id
- policy_type (basic, standard, premium)
- type_of_insurance (OCTA, KASKO)
- start_date
- end_date
- insured_person (social security number reference)
- deductible_amount
- coverage_amount

Cars (15 entries)
- registration_number
- make
- model
- year
- owner (social security number reference)
- vin
- technical_inspection_date
- technical_inspection_end_date (will be always after technical_inspection_date by 1-2 year)
- policy_number reference (can be multiple policies per car KASKO and OCTA or only one or the other)

Accidents (30-50 entries)
- accident_id
- date
- location (spatial coordinates)
- involved_cars (list of registration numbers, social security number references, damage_level (0-10 scale), damage_description, at_fault_party (social security number reference))
- involed_persons (list of social security number references, role (driver, passenger, pedestrian), injuries (none, minor, severe, fatal))

Note: ensure that some accidents involve multiple cars and persons. And there are repeat offenders.

Output entire dataset in chunks. Preferably in a file if you can. Do not pause.
